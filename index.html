However, what we should have done in the inspirational posts is not just provide you with some inspiration for your work, but also present useful photographic techniques which can help you to achieve optimal pictures for your designs. And as requested by many of you, now it is time to correct our mistake.</p>

  <p><a class="textColor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt-shift_photography" rel="nofollow">Tilt-shift photography</a> refers to the use of camera movements on small- and medium-format cameras; it usually requires the use of special lenses.
  Tilt-shift actually encompasses two different types of movements: rotation of the lens relative to the image plane, called tilt, and movement of the lens parallel to the image plane, called shift. Tilt is used to control the orientation of the plane of focus (PoF), and hence the part of an image that appears sharp; it makes use of the Scheimpflug principle. Shift is used to change the line of sight while avoiding the convergence of parallel lines, as when photographing tall buildings.
  Another, less cost-intensive technique called <a class="textColor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt-shift_miniature_faking" rel="nofollow">tilt-shift miniature faking</a> is a process in which a photograph of a life-sized location or object is manipulated so that it looks like a photograph of a miniature-scale model.
